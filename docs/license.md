/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------/
/  FatFs - Generic FAT Filesystem Module  Rx.xx                               /

Therefore FatFs license is one of the BSD-style licenses, but there is a significant feature. FatFs is mainly intended for embedded systems. In order to extend the usability for commercial products, the redistributions of FatFs in binary form, such as embedded code, binary library and any forms without source code, do not need to include about FatFs in the documentations. This is equivalent to the 1-clause BSD license. Of course FatFs is compatible with the most of open source software licenses include GNU GPL. When you redistribute the FatFs source code with changes or create a fork, the license can also be changed to GNU GPL, BSD-style license or any open source software license that not conflict with FatFs license.
